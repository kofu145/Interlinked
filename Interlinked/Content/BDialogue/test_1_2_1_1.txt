Out to stop the demon king I assume? I can see why you’d want a priest for that.
I’ve never been much of a fan of his rule… with him being evil and all.
As you can see, I’m quite past my prime. With my growing age, I’ve lost some of my skills as well as my hair.
Though if you feel as though you can take him down, I would be happy to oblige.
